# Churn Data
This data talks about churn, which is why customers leave the company and go somewhere else, and one of the companyâ€™s priorities is to reduce churn,
I started working on the reasons that will make customers leave the company and see the number of people who leave the company every month or every year and I will create a dashboard to help me identify the reasons.
